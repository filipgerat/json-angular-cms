json-angular-cms
================

This is my first project on Github. I want to learn AngularJS on this project, 
and my goal is to create a cms, that I can include in websites for small businesses.

Goals:

1. Set up Git --Done
2. Hello world Angular! --Done
3. Simple array of articles. --Done
4. Article deletion --Done
5. Editing articles
6. Adding timestamps and authors
7. Formatting the article with HTML tags
8. Saving the articles as a JSON file

----------
Ideas for enhancement

- Nice formatting (Bootstrap)
- Database of articles, each dynamically loaded as a JSON
- Abstracts, subheadings and sections for articles
- Images to articles
